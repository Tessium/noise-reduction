### Abstract
Voice recognition is becoming more and more important in everyday life of people. In real world there are many ways of implementing those algorithms but as we learn Fourier Transform why not to try. So your teams main goal is to implement simple algorithm based on Fourier Transform to recognize “YES” or “NO” words. For this task you have to record your own saying of YES and NO with your own microphone and create two files (.mp3, or wav or any other you like). Then pass it through your algorithm and demonstrate its working 
### Task
1.	Write Fourier Transform (Fast Fourier Transform) code to analyze the signal (source file you recorded)
2.	You can design one or more band pass, low pass filters to extract what you want.
3.	Use other statistical methods to increase your correct recognition rate. 
4.	Once you decode the signal you should live demo it 
5.	Make software that can decode other people’s sounds automatically 
6.	Make presentation and explain about how you did, what equations you’ve used, what kind of filter you’ve designed and etc.
